# Resume Workflow

## Step 1: Locate State Files

Search for resumable workflows:
1. **Active** (interrupted session): `.workflows/current-state.md`
2. **Paused**: `.workflows/paused-*.md`

If nothing found: "No active or paused workflows. Use `/start` to begin a new one."

## Step 2: Select Workflow

- **Only `current-state.md`** exists -> resume it directly (interrupted session).
- **Argument provided** (e.g., `/resume booking-cancellation`) -> find `.workflows/paused-booking-cancellation.md`.
- **Multiple paused** -> list all with their `feature`, `workflow`, and `updated` timestamp. Ask user to pick.
- **Conflict** (active `current-state.md` + resuming a paused file) -> offer to pause the active workflow first (Rule 6), then resume the selected one.

## Step 3: Parse and Validate State

Read the selected state file. Parse the **YAML frontmatter** to extract:
- `workflow`, `feature`, `phase`, `branch`, `output_dir`, `started`, `updated`, `retry_count`

Then run these integrity checks **before** resuming:

### 3a: Staleness Check
Compare `updated` timestamp to now. If **>7 days old**, warn:
> "This workflow was last active <N> days ago. Context may be stale."
> Options: (a) resume anyway, (b) restart from scratch, (c) abandon

### 3b: Branch Validation
If `branch` is set:
1. Run `git branch --list <branch>` -- if empty, the branch was deleted.
   - Warn: "Branch `<branch>` no longer exists. Create it fresh or pick another?"
2. Check current branch with `git branch --show-current`.
   - If on a different branch: "You're on `<current>` but the workflow uses `<branch>`. Switch to it?"
   - If user confirms: `git checkout <branch>`

### 3c: Phase Output Validation
For each phase marked `COMPLETED` in the Phase History table:
- Check that the output file in the Output column exists under `.workflows/<feature>/`
- If missing: warn "Phase output `<file>` is missing -- context for that phase is lost. Continuing without it."

### 3d: Workflow Skill Validation
Check that `.claude/skills/<workflow>/SKILL.md` exists.
- If missing: "The `<workflow>` skill no longer exists (may have been removed or renamed during an upgrade). Cannot resume. Options: (a) abandon, (b) map to a different skill."

## Step 4: Activate the Workflow

If resuming a **paused** file:
1. If `current-state.md` already exists, confirm it should be paused first (Step 2 conflict handling).
2. Rename `.workflows/paused-<feature>.md` -> `.workflows/current-state.md` using your Write tool (write content to new path, then delete old file).

## Step 5: Load Context

Build full context by reading files **in this order**:
1. `.workflows/current-state.md` -- current state and decision history from the Context section
2. All phase output files from `.workflows/<feature>/` in chronological order -- this reconstructs what was analyzed, decided, and built
3. `.claude/skills/<workflow>/SKILL.md` -- the workflow definition to find the current phase instructions

## Step 6: Report Status

Present a summary:
```
Resuming: <workflow> -- <feature>
Branch: <branch> (checked out: yes/no)
Phase: <current-phase>
Last updated: <updated>
Age: <days since started>

Completed phases:
  <phase> -- <notes> (<output-file> exists/MISSING)

Current: <active-phase>
Remaining: <phases-not-yet-started>

Key context:
  <bullet points from Context section of state file>
```

Ask: "Continue from `<active-phase>`?"

## Step 7: Resume Execution

1. If the current branch is wrong and user approved checkout: `git checkout <branch>`
2. Read the current phase section in `.claude/skills/<workflow>/SKILL.md`
3. **Mid-phase recovery**: If the current phase supports checkpoints (IMPLEMENT, MIGRATE, EXECUTE -- see Rule 11), read the phase output file for `### Checkpoint:` entries. Resume from the step **after** the last checkpoint.
4. Continue executing the phase
5. After each phase: write phase output (Rule 1), update state frontmatter and Phase History, check workflow completion (Rule 5)
